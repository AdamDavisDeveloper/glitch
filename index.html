        </h2>
        <p>
          adam is an 210 year old honeybee detective who wishes to be taken seriously in his field. <br/>
          he is the only person alive who has been awarded the Vorpal Sword achievement from "That Shack Over by the Wendy's on 6th" and has graduated from Oxford with a degree in nuclear physics. <br/>
          adam spends his free time befriending garbage bears (racoons) and defriending those flocks of sheep who won't quit literally flooding his front lawn every morning until he feeds them pb&j sandwiches.
